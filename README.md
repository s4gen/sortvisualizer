# sortvisualizer
AVAILABLE AT https://quicksort-visualizer.netlify.app/

It's a quicksort visualizer. It generates random lines, so there will be duplicates of the same length of line. This was a challenge because of the optimization aspect, in my opinion. Normally, I'd just rerender the entire canvas when swapping two "lines" but this only swaps out those exact lines while leaving everything else untouched. Pretty elementary, but it was a good way to get started with HTML canvas. I'm pretty proud of this, overall.
